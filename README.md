#strict-lib

Type safe C++20 numerical library. Offers customized analogues of built-in arithmetic types, flexible
fixed-size and dynamic arrays, lazy evaluation, extensive support for constexpr, and rigorous error handling.
Two-dimensional arrays are not included since some functionality is not complete yet. Documentation, testing,
and additional functionality, such as numerically stable operations, is an ongoing work.
